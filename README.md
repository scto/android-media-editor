# Android Media Editor

This is a library that allows any Android application to quickly add Photo and Video editing.

It is very much in the early stages, and maybe the API is not well adapted for applications other than PixelDroid. Feedback and help is welcome!

## Installation

TODO (JitPack instructions)

## Usage

First, add the activities you are going to use to your `AndroidManifest.xml`. If you want video editing, add

```xml
<activity android:name="org.pixeldroid.media_editor.photoEdit.VideoEditActivity" />
```

If you want photo editing, add 

```xml
<activity android:name="org.pixeldroid.media_editor.photoEdit.PhotoEditActivity" />

<activity android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity"
            android:screenOrientation="sensorPortrait"
            android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar"/>
```

To edit a photo, open the relevant activity with an Intent: 

```kotlin

val intent = Intent(this,
        if(video) VideoEditActivity::class.java else PhotoEditActivity::class.java
    )
    .putExtra(PhotoEditActivity.PICTURE_URI, model.getPhotoData().value!![position].imageUri)
    .putExtra(PhotoEditActivity.PICTURE_POSITION, position)

editResultContract.launch(intent)
```

where `editResultContract` is a ActivityResultLauncher like this:

```kotlin
private val editResultContract: ActivityResultLauncher<Intent> = registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()){
    result: ActivityResult? ->
    if (result?.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK && result.data != null) {
        // The edit returned successfully, you can get the results from the intent data:

        // Position: this is the value you gave while creating the Intent
        val position: Int = result.data!!.getIntExtra(PhotoEditActivity.PICTURE_POSITION, 0)

        // If you edited a video:
        if(video){
            val modified: Boolean = data.getBooleanExtra(VideoEditActivity.MODIFIED, false)
            if(modified){
                val videoEncodingArguments: VideoEditActivity.VideoEditArguments? = data.getSerializableExtra(VideoEditActivity.VIDEO_ARGUMENTS_TAG) as? VideoEditActivity.VideoEditArguments

                // You need to track the encoding sessions and cancel them when needed.
                // Here, we cancel the previous session for this image, because we are about to start a new one
                sessionMap[imageUri]?.let { VideoEditActivity.cancelEncoding(it) }


                videoEncodingArguments?.let {
                    VideoEditActivity.startEncoding(imageUri, it, context,
                        // Callback that will register new sessions as they are started.
                        // See below for signature
                        registerNewFFmpegSession = ::registerNewFFmpegSession,
                        // Callback that will let you track temporary files as they are created, such as results of the video editing or files used to store video analysis results.
                        // Move or copy files you want to keep, then delete the rest to not leak space.
                        // See below for signature.
                        trackTempFile = ::trackTempFile,
                        // Callback used to inform you of progress in the video editing.
                        // See below for signature.
                        videoEncodeProgress = ::videoEncodeProgress
                    )
                }
            }

        }
        // Otherwise it was an image:
        else imageUri = data.getStringExtra(org.pixeldroid.media_editor.photoEdit.PhotoEditActivity.PICTURE_URI)!!.toUri()


    } else if(result?.resultCode != Activity.RESULT_CANCELED){
        Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "Error while editing", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}

/**
 * Register a new session in a map (you can manage them as you prefer, but don't forget to cancel them whenever you can)
 */
fun registerNewFFmpegSession(uri: Uri, sessionId: Long) {
    sessionMap[uri] = sessionId
}

/**
 * Track temporary files. Here, they are just added to an ArrayList
 */
fun trackTempFile(file: File) {
    tempFiles.add(file)
}

/**
     * @param originalUri the Uri of the file you sent to be edited
     * @param progress percentage of (this pass of) encoding that is done
     * @param firstPass Whether this is the first pass (currently for analysis of video stabilization) or the second (and last) pass.
     * @param outputVideoPath when not null, it means the encoding is done and the result is saved in this file
     * @param error is true when there has been an error during encoding.
     */
fun videoEncodeProgress(originalUri: Uri, progress: Int, firstPass: Boolean, outputVideoPath: Uri?, error: Boolean){}

```

`PICTURE_POSITION` is an integer that you give in the Intent, and it gets passed back in the result data, to help you know which picture just finished editing. If you only have one picture, you don't need to put it in the Intent, or worry about it in the result.

You should keep track the encoding sessions, and cancel them when you know you don't need them anymore. For example when the activity is destroyed, or when you launch a new encoding for the same video that should override the last one.


## Help, something is not working :(

If something is not clear, please go look in the [PixelDroid code](https://gitlab.shinice.net/pixeldroid/PixelDroid) for more precision in how the library is used. If that doesn't help, send a message on Matrix: `#pixeldroid:gnugen.ch`
